## GIT practice

## Bash practice

- The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.

The command line is a text based interface to the system, it allows you to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard. Feedback is received in the form of text.
The command line is on every system, however every system is different so finding it will depend on your particular system

- Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.

pwd(print working directory) and ls(list) are two of the commands you would use in the linux directory system to navigate through the paths.pwd tells you where you are and ls tells you what is there.

- More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.

Technically everything is a file in linux (including directories, keyboards and monitors). Linux is case sensitive, meaning you could have two files share the same name, and as long as they have different cases, linux recognizes them as two seperate files. Same can go for having spaces in between a folder name. The way to resolve the space "problem" is through using quotes.

- Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

The man pages assist you in trying to find a particular command but aren't quite sure what the command name is
man <command>
Look up the manual page for a particular command.
man -k <search term>
Does a search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
<term>
Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
n
select the next found item after a search.

- File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.

command for making a directory - mkdir
command for renaming a directory -
command for removing a directory/file - rmdir/ rm [options] <file>
command for copying a file/directory- cp [options] <source> <destination>
command for moving a file/directory - mv [options] <source> <destination>

an aha moment here was figuring out that even though directories and files are essentially recognized the same in the linux system, they still have their own set of commands.

- Cheat Sheet - A quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial.

This cheat sheet would be a great future reference in figuring out commands that would go into the terminal.

## Typing practice

## Career Coaching Pre-work

### Prep Your Mindset

**Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice**

- what I got from this article is that practice is key, not only that practice has to be deliberate and challenging in order to be truly effective.

**Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindse**

- a growth mindset, sort of means loving and appreciating a challenge, also accepting that you're smart, you just haven't gotten to that point yet . A fixed mindset, running from difficulty.
- The word yet, helps with the mindset of students

**Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit**

- "Grit is passion and perseverence for very long term goals" - Angela Lee
- talent and grit are unrelated and just having talent won't mean you'll stick with it
- connects with the growth mindset idiology that the ability to learn in not fixed and can change with the amount of effort put in\
- failure is temporary

**Alain De Botton on Redefining Success**  

- Alain defines a snob as someone who uses a small part that they know about you and figures they know everything about you

- we live in a world that gives emotional rewards/ respect based on how much materials we attain

- envy is connected to relatibility, too soon but no one ever envied the Queen of England because no one could relate to her

- a meritocratic society is one that believes through hard work, time and effort you'll deservedly get to the top and vice versa

**Emotional intelligence**
So for my self awareness I got a 21 and while it's above 18 an area I could work on in this aspect could be trusting my gut instinct. for my self management score I got a 23 and what I've learned is that I'm very good at holding in anger. for my social awareness score I scored a 21 and what I learned is to trust the read I get on people in my surrounding and finally for my Relationship management, I scored a 20 and I find that I normally don't try to get people to see my view very hard.

**Bias Self-Assessment**
My highest score was in the Bias and the Brain . This does surprise me, since my last assesment had me highest for the connect to mitigate bias(it is down 1 point) I suppose I got a higher score, because i'm more aware that I take time to assess all situations before I make any decisions. The questions were geared to how I assess situations and most of my answers went toward taking a step back and really thinking about it. My lowest score was in the effective courage section, does not surprise me. This section was low on my last assessment as well and most of the questions are definetely things that I'm working on.

### Engineering Readings

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- Curiosity/ ability to ask questions and not feel very discouraged or intimidated

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- plan /make a frame work to avoid the problem
- ask for help (15 min rule)
- google(lots of google)
