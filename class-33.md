### The code I’m still ashamed of

I think that this was a very interesting article since it showed me a perspective i've never thought of as a coder. It's also interesting to also see how the author's thought process was ranging from technically saying that what he did was technically legal and showing how he did what the client wanted without question or pause. In the end i'm glad that he points out how technology will eventually be playing a larger role in our lives such as taking us places or diagnosing diseases. He makes a good point in saying how because of the larger roles that'll come into play, we must make a stronge stance with our ethics

### Self Driving Car Ethics

This article introduced a lot of ethical dilemmas with AV's that I've truly never thought of before. My stance before this article was always in favor of AVs just because i'm not a big fan of driving and I do like the additional pros such as senior citizens being on the road and also the big safety factor of 35000 less accidents. After the article presented the problem of how would an AV react if it was presented with an impossible situation of either hitting another car, a bus or veer off the road and put your life in danger. It definitely put me in a verrry gray spot
