Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

What is the first principle of Redux?

- single source of truth
- state is read only
- changes are made with pure functions

what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?

- Reducer, functions that take the current state and action as argument and generate a new state

(state, action) => newState.

It brings together the state, reducers and  actions that makeup your app. A redux reducer has a root reducer function that is responsible for handling all of the actions that are siapached and creating a new state everytime

Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.

- getState, helps you retrieve current state of redux store

- dispatch, it allow you to dispatch an action to change a state in your application

- subscribe, helps register a callback that store will call when action has been dispatched and as soon as state has update the view will re-render automatically.

Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.

It's a helper function that turns an object that has differing reducing functions into a single reducing function.

It's usefule because it you can then pass the function in createStore.
